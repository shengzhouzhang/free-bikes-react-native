This is a demo app for demonstrate my skills only. Everything mentions in the spec is done. The program is runnable and has been tested with Xcode iPhone 6 simulator.

# Technical Stacks

# Installation

Please navigate to the root folder of this program. And do

```
$ npm install
```

# Testing

Please do

```
$ npm test
```

# Running

It would be good to run this program in the same environment, please check the environment above.

To run the program with the ISO Simulator, please do

```
$ npm start
```

Please use `npm start` instead of `react-native start` or `react-native run-ios`.

There is a chance the simulator loads the program before server is ready. If this happened, please reload the program on simulator by pressing COMMAND + R or CONTROL + R.
